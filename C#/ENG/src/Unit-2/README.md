## Concepts you'll learn.

In the previous module, we learned about the actors and messages.  In this module, we will look more detailed at how we can create and use the actors and messages. 

So, in this module, we will start by creating an actor and look at the design patterns which we must follow when creating the actor.

We will learn more about the PID and why we do not have direct links to actors when we send them messages. We will learn how to classify and process custom messages and which patterns are best to use. 

Next, we'll take a more detailed look at how to create an instance of our actor and how the Props class is involved in this process.
