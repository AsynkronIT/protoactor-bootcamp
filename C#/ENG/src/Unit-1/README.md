## Concepts you'll learn.

Welcome to the course on building parallel applications based on the actor model and the Proto.Actor platform. Creating parallel, distributed, and robust applications is a complicated task. However, using the actor model and the Proto.Actor platform significantly simplifies this task.

With Proto. Actor, you no longer have to worry about manually managing threads and locking shared resources. Instead, you will use high-level abstractions such as Actors and Messages.

Along with a significant simplification of working with parallel applications, Proto.Actor allows you to scale our application to multiple computers using the Proto.Actor Cluster. We can use all the features of cluster processing without changing our code at all, and we can also split our application into several subsystems and write these subsystems in different programming languages. And they will interact with each other as if you were writing it in the same language. 

Also, our applications will be able to self-recover in case of failures.  It will allow us to reduce the time for eliminating errors and use this time to create new functionality for your application.

In this module, we will define the actor model and show how the Proto.Actor platform will help us work with actors.
